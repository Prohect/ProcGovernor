A high-performance Windows process management service written in Rust that automatically applies CPU affinity, priority, I/O priority, and memory priority rules to running processes based on configuration files.

## Overview

ProcGovernor continuously monitors running processes and applies customized scheduling policies based on rules defined in configuration files. It supports:

- **Process Priority Management**: Set process priority class (Idle to Real-time) — see [Priority Levels](#priority-levels)
- **CPU Affinity**: Hard-pin processes to specific logical processors (legacy ≤64 core systems) — see [`apply_affinity()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/apply_affinity.md)
- **CPU Sets**: Soft CPU preferences across all processor groups (modern >64 core systems) — see [`apply_process_default_cpuset()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/apply_process_default_cpuset.md)
- **Prime Thread Scheduling**: Dynamically identify and assign CPU-intensive threads to designated "prime" cores — see [Prime Thread Scheduling](#prime-thread-scheduling) section below
- **Ideal Processor Assignment**: Static thread-to-CPU assignment for top N busiest threads — see [Ideal Processor Assignment](#ideal-processor-assignment) section below
- **I/O Priority Control**: Control disk I/O scheduling priority — see [`apply_io_priority()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/apply_io_priority.md)
- **Memory Priority Control**: Adjust memory page priority for process working set — see [`apply_memory_priority()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/apply_memory_priority.md)
- **Hot Reload**: Automatically detect and apply config file changes
- **Rule Grades**: Control application frequency per process rule — see [Rule Grades](#rule-grades)

### Prime Thread Scheduling

The prime thread scheduler dynamically identifies the most CPU-intensive threads and assigns them to designated "prime" cores using Windows CPU Sets:

**Algorithm:**
- Monitors thread CPU cycle consumption at configurable intervals via [`prefetch_all_thread_cycles()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/prefetch_all_thread_cycles.md)
- Applies hysteresis to prevent thrashing:
  - **Entry threshold**: Thread must exceed configured % of max cycles to become a candidate
  - **Keep threshold**: Once promoted, thread stays prime if above configured % of max cycles
  - **Active streak**: Requires consecutive active intervals before promotion
- Filters low-activity threads automatically
- Supports multi-segment CPU assignment: different modules can use different core sets
- Per-module thread priority control (explicit or auto-boost)
- Thread tracking mode: logs detailed statistics when process exits

See [`apply_prime_threads()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/apply_prime_threads.md) and the [scheduler module](docs/en-US/scheduler.rs/README.md) for implementation details.

**Thread Tracking Output:**
When a tracked process exits, detailed statistics are logged for top N threads:
- Thread ID and total CPU cycles consumed
- Start address resolved to `module.dll+offset` format
- Kernel time and user time
- Thread priority, base priority, context switches
- Thread state and wait reason

### Ideal Processor Assignment

An optional `ideal` specification assigns preferred processors to the most CPU-active threads, using the **same hysteresis-based filter** as prime thread scheduling.

**Algorithm:**
- Per-iteration cycle data is provided by the shared [`prefetch_all_thread_cycles()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/prefetch_all_thread_cycles.md) pass (one `QueryThreadCycleTime` per thread, capped at the logical-CPU count)
- Applies [`MIN_ACTIVE_STREAK`](docs/en-US/config.rs/ConfigConstants.md), [`ENTRY_THRESHOLD`](docs/en-US/config.rs/ConfigConstants.md), and [`KEEP_THRESHOLD`](docs/en-US/config.rs/ConfigConstants.md) constants — identical to prime thread scheduling:
  - **Pass 1 (keep)**: threads already assigned and still above `KEEP_THRESHOLD` retain their slot with **zero write syscalls**
  - **Pass 2 (promote)**: new candidates above `ENTRY_THRESHOLD` whose streak counter has reached `MIN_ACTIVE_STREAK` receive a slot
- Lazy set: if a newly-selected thread's current ideal processor is already in the free CPU pool, `SetThreadIdealProcessorEx` is skipped — the slot is claimed in-place
- Demotion: threads that fall out of selection have their original ideal processor restored
- Each assignment log line includes `start=module+offset` (e.g. `start=cs2.exe+0xEA60`)
- Multi-rule syntax allows different CPU sets for different module prefixes

See [`apply_ideal_processors()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/apply_ideal_processors.md) for implementation details.

### Ideal Processor Reset

When a process's CPU affinity is changed, ProcGovernor automatically resets per-thread ideal processor assignments to prevent Windows from clamping threads to narrow CPU ranges.

This can also be enabled for CPU set changes by prefixing the cpuset field with `@`:

```ini
# After setting CPU set to 0-3, redistribute thread ideal processors across CPUs 0-3
game.exe:normal:*a:@0-3:*p:normal:normal:1
```

**How it works:**
- Collects threads' total CPU time and sorts in descending order
- Assigns ideal processors round-robin across the configured CPUs
- Applies a small random shift to avoid clumping
- Runs automatically after affinity changes, or after CPU set changes when `@` prefix is used

See [`reset_thread_ideal_processors()`](docs/en-US/apply.rs/reset_thread_ideal_processors.md) for implementation details.

## Configuration

The configuration file uses INI-like format with sections for constants, aliases, and rules.

Process rules follow this format:
```
process_name:priority:affinity:cpuset:prime_cpus[@prefixes]:io_priority:memory_priority:ideal[@prefixes]:grade
```

See [`ProcessLevelConfig`](docs/en-US/config.rs/ProcessLevelConfig.md) for the parsed representation.

### CPU Specification Formats

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Range | `0-7` | Cores 0 through 7 |
| Multiple ranges | `0-7;64-71` | For systems with >64 logical processors |
| Individual | `0;2;4;6` | Specific cores |
| Single | `5` | Single core (NOT a bitmask) |
| Hex mask | `0xFF` | Legacy format (≤64 cores only) |
| Alias | `*pcore` | Reference to predefined CPU alias |

**Important:** Plain numbers mean core indices, not bitmasks. Use `0-7` for cores 0-7, NOT `7`.

### Rule Grades

The `grade` field (default: 1) controls how often a rule is applied:

| Grade | Frequency | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `1` | Every loop | Critical processes (games, real-time apps) |
| `2` | Every 2nd loop | Semi-critical processes |
| `5` | Every 5th loop | Background utilities |
| `10` | Every 10th loop | Rarely changing processes |

### Priority Levels

**Process Priority:** `none`, `idle`, `below normal`, `normal`, `above normal`, `high`, `real time`

**Thread Priority:** `none`, `idle`, `lowest`, `below normal`, `normal`, `above normal`, `highest`, `time critical`

**I/O Priority:** `none`, `very low`, `low`, `normal`, `high` (admin required for high)

**Memory Priority:** `none`, `very low`, `low`, `medium`, `below normal`, `normal`

For detailed configuration syntax, including aliases, groups, prime scheduling, ideal assignment, constants, and examples, see [parse_and_insert_rules](docs/en-US/config.rs/parse_and_insert_rules.md).

## Tools

### Config Validation

Validate your configuration before running:
```bash
ProcGovernor.exe -validate -config my_config.ini
```

### Dry Run Mode

Preview changes without applying them:
```bash
ProcGovernor.exe -dryrun -noUAC -config test.ini
```

### Process Discovery

Find processes not covered by your config:
```bash
ProcGovernor.exe -find -blacklist blacklist.ini
```

### Config Conversion

Convert Process Lasso config format:
```bash
ProcGovernor.exe -convert -in prolasso.ini -out my_config.ini
```

### Config Auto-Grouping

Automatically merge rules with identical settings into named group blocks:
```bash
ProcGovernor.exe -autogroup -in config.ini -out config_grouped.ini
```

Rules that share the exact same rule string are collected into a `grp_N { }` block, with members sorted alphabetically. Groups that fit within 128 characters are written on a single line; larger groups wrap across multiple lines with `: `-separated members, each line kept under 128 characters.

**Input:**
```ini
explorer.exe:none:*a:*e:0:none:none:0:4
cmd.exe:none:*a:*e:0:none:none:0:4
notepad.exe:none:*a:*e:0:none:none:0:4
```

**Output:**
```ini
grp_0 { cmd.exe: explorer.exe: notepad.exe }:none:*a:*e:0:none:none:0:4
```

The preamble (`@constants`, `*aliases`, and leading comments) is preserved verbatim. Per-process inline comments between rules are dropped during regrouping.

See [`sort_and_group_config()`](docs/en-US/config.rs/sort_and_group_config.md) for implementation.

## How It Works

ProcGovernor continuously monitors running processes and applies configured rules for process priority, CPU affinity/sets, I/O/memory priority, prime thread scheduling, and ideal processor assignment. It uses ETW for reactive process detection and supports hot reloading of config files.

For detailed architecture and implementation, see [docs/main.md](docs/en-US/main.rs/README.md).

## Known Behaviors

7. **`[SET_AFFINITY][ACCESS_DENIED]` on own child processes**: When this service spawns a child process (e.g. `conhost.exe` attached by a scheduled task runner or a UAC re-launch) that happens to match one of the configured rules, it will attempt to apply affinity and log a line such as:

   ```
   apply_config: [SET_AFFINITY][ACCESS_DENIED]  6976-conhost.exe
   ```

   to `.find.log`. This is **intentional** — the service applies rules to every matching process name it sees in the snapshot, including its own short-lived children. The child is terminated before the main loop starts (see startup cleanup), so this entry will appear at most once per run and can be safely ignored.

8. **`[OPEN][ACCESS_DENIED]` per-thread deduplication**: When [`apply_process_level()`](docs/en-US/main.rs/apply_process_level.md)/[`apply_thread_level()`](docs/en-US/main.rs/apply_thread_level.md) fails to open a process or thread due to `ACCESS_DENIED` (or any other error), the error is written to `.find.log` exactly once per unique `(pid, tid, process_name, operation)` combination. After each snapshot, the deduplication map is reconciled: entries whose PID has exited or been reused for a different executable are evicted, so if the same process name later re-appears under a new PID the error fires once more. Multiple concurrent instances of the same executable (e.g. several `svchost.exe` processes with different PIDs) are tracked independently — one denied instance never silences errors for any other PID sharing the same name.

See [`is_new_error()`](docs/en-US/logging.rs/is_new_error.md) for error deduplication implementation.

## Known Limitations

1. **CPU Affinity ≤64 cores**: The legacy SetProcessAffinityMask API only works within a single processor group. For >64 core systems, use CPU Sets instead.

2. **Multi-group/NUMA systems**: This project has not been tested on multi-processor-group or NUMA systems. The `ideal` processor assignment currently assigns processors within processor group 0 only. Systems with >64 logical processors or multiple CPU groups may experience unexpected behavior.

3. **Protected processes**: Processes like `csrss.exe` and `smss.exe` cannot be modified, even with admin privileges.

4. **Console output with elevation**: When using `-console` with UAC elevation, the elevated process spawns in a new window that closes immediately. Use log file output instead.

5. **Thread start address resolution**: Requires admin elevation with SeDebugPrivilege. Without elevation, start addresses show as `0x0`.

6. **Timer resolution**: The system timer resolution affects loop precision. Very low values (<1ms) may impact system stability.
