# mask_to_cpu_indices function (config.rs)

Converts a 64-bit CPU bitmask into a sorted list of individual CPU indices. Each set bit in the mask corresponds to a logical processor number in the output list.

## Syntax

```rust
fn mask_to_cpu_indices(mask: u64) -> List<[u32; CONSUMER_CPUS]>
```

## Parameters

`mask: u64`

A 64-bit bitmask where bit *N* being set indicates that logical processor *N* should be included in the output list. For example, `0x15` (binary `10101`) represents processors 0, 2, and 4.

## Return value

`List<[u32; CONSUMER_CPUS]>` — A stack-allocated small vector of CPU indices, sorted in ascending order. If `mask` is `0`, the returned list is empty.

## Remarks

The function iterates over bit positions 0 through 63, testing each bit with `(mask >> i) & 1 == 1`. Matching positions are collected into the output list via the `Iterator::collect()` trait. Because bits are tested from LSB to MSB, the resulting list is inherently sorted in ascending order.

### Limitations

- The function supports a maximum of 64 logical processors, which is the limit of a single Windows processor group. Systems with more than 64 processors require range-based CPU specifications (`"0-7;64-71"`) handled by [parse_cpu_spec](parse_cpu_spec.md) instead of bitmask notation.
- The return type uses `CONSUMER_CPUS` (32) as the inline capacity. If more than 32 CPUs are set in the mask, the list spills to heap allocation, which is acceptable for the configuration parsing hot path.

### Visibility

This function is module-private (`fn`, not `pub fn`). It is called exclusively by [parse_cpu_spec](parse_cpu_spec.md) when parsing hexadecimal CPU mask strings (e.g., `"0xFF"`).

### Inverse operation

The inverse of this function is [cpu_indices_to_mask](cpu_indices_to_mask.md), which converts a slice of CPU indices back to a `usize` bitmask.
